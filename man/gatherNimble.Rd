\title{
  Gather NIMBLE samples
}
\description{
  Base function called by `RunNimbleParallel` used to gather and organize NIMBLE samples into an mcmcOutput object.
}
\usage{
  gatherNimble(read.path, burnin = 1, ni.block, base.thin, max.samples.saved)
}
\arguments{
  \item{read.path}{Path to directory containing sample blocks generated by `RunNimbleParallel`.}
  \item{burnin}{Number of samples to discard at the beginning of each chain when gathering MCMC samples from saved blocks.}
  \item{ni.block}{Number of samples in each sampling block.}
  \item{base.thin}{Base thinning rate implemented for model run (i.e., n.thin for initial call to `runNimble`). Needed to correctly track burnin.}
  \item{max.samples.saved}{Integer that sets max samples to save across chains in final model object. Additional thinning of posterior samples (i.e., after samples are recovered from processing clusters) is implemented as necessary to limit the size of the model object to this level.}
}
\value{
  \item{out}{MCMC samples organized as an 'mcmcOutput' object.}
  \item{nblks}{the number of sampling blocks}
  \item{additional.thin.rate}{Any additional thinning rate if max.samples.saved is specified. Set to 1 if max.samples.saved is NULL.}
}
