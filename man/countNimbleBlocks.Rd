\title{
  Count NIMBLE sampling blocks in dump folder
}
\description{
  Base function used by `RunNimbleParallel` to count number of NIMBLE sampling blocks to inform when to gather samples and check convergence.
}
\usage{
  countNimbleBlocks(read.path, burnin, ni.block)
}
\arguments{
  \item{read.path}{Path to directory containing sample blocks generated by `RunNimbleParallel`.}
  \item{burnin}{Number of samples to discard at the beginning of each chain when gathering MCMC samples from saved blocks.}
  \item{ni.block}{Number of samples in each sampling block.}
}
\value{
  \item{m}{Table whose rownames are Rdata files containing sampling blocks in the specified folder to be gathered after applying burnin. Table values list the blocks and chains that each file belongs to.}
  \item{nblks}{The number of sampling blocks represented in what has been saved contained in the specified folder.}
