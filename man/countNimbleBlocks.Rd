}
\arguments{

  \item{burnin}{Number of samples to discard at the beginning of each chain when gathering MCMC samples from saved blocks.}
  \item{ni.block}{Number of samples in each sampling block.}
}
\value{
  \item{m}{Table whose rownames are Rdata files containing sampling blocks in the specified folder to be gathered after applying burnin. Table values list the blocks and chains that each file belongs to.}
